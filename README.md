# Legacy mod, not required anymore!

This mod was made to create a workaround for a crash with vanilla minecraft between 21w15a and 1.17 pre-1. Since they fixed this issue, this doesn't do anything anymore.

# This also doesn't fix the same problem with Optifine, but...

to fix that, read this [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j30fiFudP_MnuQNM8g_FyzGmblqXL0iz/view?usp=sharing). This requires the use of MultiMC, since the vanilla launcher doesn't allow for library overrides without disabling the internet connection first.

# AMD driver bug fix for minecraft

Fixes the crashes when reloading resource packs or loading into worlds in 1.17 snapshots (and possibly beyond depending on whether they fix this) on some AMD cards.
